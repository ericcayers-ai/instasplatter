# Research stack (v0.3.1)

Evidence-first inventory: **[PAPER-SWEEP-2024+.md](./PAPER-SWEEP-2024+.md)** (40+ entries, greppable status, license, integration points).

Post-2024 Gaussian Splatting and feed-forward SfM / mesh work evaluated for
InstaSplatter. Policy: integrate what improves quality and is license-viable;
special opt-in only for uncertain or NC-licensed paths. Prefer the **newest**
viable release of each component. Features **compose (AND)**; they are not
mutually exclusive "pick one model" toggles unless technically required.

## Composed default pipeline

```
Video → frame gate
  → COLMAP (or live init)  + optional VGGT-Ω if Research ON
  → Neural densify (DAV2 / VGGT-commercial) ∧ COLMAP MVS ∧ sparse seed → init.ply
  → Brush: progressive ∧ mip bake ∧ AbsGS opac/scale L1 ∧ MCMC mean-noise knobs
  → [brush-custom] in-loop mip / SpotLess / appearance when override binary present
  → Fixer polish when installed (NVIDIA Open Model, commercial OK)
  → Live PLY lerp viewport
  → Mesh: dense TSDF ∧ smooth ∧ island cull ∧ oriented-point fallback
```

## Counts (maintain with PAPER-SWEEP)

| Bucket | Count (approx.) |
| --- | --- |
| Inventories in PAPER-SWEEP | **45** |
| wired-default-ON / integrated | **~22** |
| opt-in (Research / special) | **~6** |
| deferred (fork / later) | **~12** |

## VGGT-Ω (VGGT-Omega) — newest, not default

| Item | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Paper | CVPR 2026 Oral, Meta + Oxford, arXiv:2605.15195 |
| Code | https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggt-omega |
| Hugging Face | `facebook/VGGT-Omega` (`vggt_omega_1b_512.pt` preferred) |
| License | **CC BY-NC-4.0** (non-commercial) as of May 2026 |
| Decision | **Research opt-in only** (`allowResearchSidecars`). Prefer over VGGT-1B-Commercial when research is enabled. |
| Why not ON by default | No commercial Omega checkpoint yet. |

## Rejected or special opt-in

| Project | License | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VGGT-1B (original NC) | CC BY-NC | Research opt-in only |
| MASt3R / DUSt3R | CC BY-NC-SA | Not shipped |
| π³ / Pi3 weights | CC BY-NC (code BSD) | Not shipped |
| SuGaR | mixed / GS-license adjacent | Algorithm reference; oriented-point fallback is our own |
| GOF / PGSR / RaDe-GS | often Inria NC | Reference only |
| Difix3D+ research weights | research / gated | Research sidecar `difix` (prefer Fixer for commercial) |
| GSFixer / GSFix3D | Apache + **GS NC** + RAIL++ | Deferred / rejected for commercial bundling |
| CityGaussian / FlashSplat | NC / wrong task | Skip |
| SAM2 masks | Apache | Sidecar later (SpotLess path) |

## Mesh overhaul

| Change | Source inspiration | License stance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Default resolution 768, render 1024 | 2DGS / AGS-Mesh | our code |
| Depth confidence floor (α≥0.62) | DN-Splatter | our code |
| Laplacian smooth + island cull | standard cleanup | our code |
| Oriented-point TSDF rebuild fallback | DN-Splatter / AGS-Mesh | recipe only |
| Quality presets draft / high / max | — | our code |
| UV atlas | — | still deferred |
| Full screened Poisson | — | deferred |

## Brush fork path

Stock Brush remains the default download. Drop a custom build at
`%LOCALAPPDATA%/InstaSplatter/engines/brush-custom/brush_app.exe` to override
(auto-detected; see engine status `brushCustom`).

See `tools/brush-fork/README.md` and `tools/brush-fork/patches/` for AbsGS densify,
true in-loop mip, MCMC relocate, appearance embeddings, SpotLess masks, and
FastGS-style budgeted densify.

## Sidecar install

See `tools/sidecars/README.md`. Base app never depends on PyTorch.

| Folder | When used |
| --- | --- |
| `depth-anything-v2` | Default neural densify (Apache) |
| `vggt-commercial` (+ `ACCEPTED`) | Default neural SfM densify |
| `vggt-omega` | Research ON only |
| `fixer` | Default polish when present (NVIDIA Open Model) |
| `difix` | Research ON only |
| `gsplat-train` | **Default trainer on NVIDIA** when installed (Apache-2.0) |

## gsplat parity (nerfstudio-project/gsplat, Apache-2.0)

Audited against `_refs/gsplat` main (2026-07-14 clone). Second engine path:
`pipeline/gsplat.rs` + `tools/sidecars/gsplat-train/`.

| gsplat feature | InstaSplatter status |
| --- | --- |
| CUDA rasterization library | Via `gsplat-train` sidecar (not vendored into installer) |
| `simple_trainer` default strategy | Wired as `gsplatStrategy=default` |
| AbsGrad densify (`DefaultStrategy.absgrad`) | **ON** by default when strategy=default |
| MCMC densify (`MCMCStrategy`) | **ON** default strategy (`mcmc`) |
| Antialiased / mip raster (`rasterize_mode=antialiased`) | **ON** (`gsplatAntialiased`) |
| Opacity / scale regularizers | Mapped from AbsGS-style strictness losses |
| Appearance embeddings (`app_opt`) | **ON** when full `simple_trainer` available |
| Bilateral grid post-process | **ON** (`gsplatBilateralGrid`); needs bilagrid dep |
| PPISP alternative | Research/extra dep; pass `postProcessing=ppisp` via full trainer |
| Sparse Adam / visible Adam | Deferred (experimental in gsplat) |
| Packed raster | Deferred (memory mode) |
| 3DGUT (`with_ut` + `with_eval3d`) | Deferred (MCMC-only path; nvidia/eval focused) |
| 2DGS trainer (`simple_trainer_2dgs`) | Deferred; mesh recipe already uses 2DGS-style TSDF |
| HiGS inference render | Deferred (viewer-side) |
| PNG compression / SOG export | Deferred |
| LiDAR / NCore / surgical dynamic | Out of scope |
| Brush progressive + mip bake + live lerp | Kept on Brush path; still compose with dense init |

**Trainer Auto:** CUDA + `gsplat-train` installed → gsplat; else Brush (portable).
